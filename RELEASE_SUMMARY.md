# ðŸŽ‰ ClipSync Release Setup Complete!

Your ClipSync project is now configured to create GitHub releases with both ARM64 and Intel DMG files for macOS.

## âœ… What's Been Set Up

### 1. **Package.json Configuration**

- Added new build scripts for ARM64 and Intel DMG files
- Updated electron-builder configuration for both architectures
- Fixed GitHub repository settings

### 2. **GitHub Actions Workflow**

- **File**: `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- **Triggers**: Git tags (`v*`) or manual workflow dispatch
- **Builds**: All platforms (macOS, Windows, Linux)
- **Outputs**: Both ARM64 and Intel DMG files automatically

### 3. **Manual Build Script**

- **File**: `scripts/build-release.sh`
- **Usage**: `./scripts/build-release.sh`
- **Features**: Interactive script with colored output

### 4. **macOS Entitlements**

- **File**: `assets/entitlements.mac.plist`
- **Purpose**: Required for code signing and notarization

### 5. **Documentation**

- **File**: `docs/RELEASE.md`
- **Content**: Complete release guide with troubleshooting

## ðŸš€ How to Create a Release

### Option 1: Automated (Recommended)

```bash
# Create and push a tag
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

### Option 2: Manual Trigger

1. Go to GitHub â†’ Actions â†’ Release workflow
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Enter version (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
4. Click "Run workflow"

### Option 3: Local Build

```bash
# Use the build script
./scripts/build-release.sh

# Or manual commands
npm run dist:mac:arm64  # ARM64 DMG
npm run dist:mac:x64    # Intel DMG
```

## ðŸ“¦ Generated Files

After building, you'll get:

- `ClipSync-1.0.0-arm64.dmg` - For Apple Silicon Macs (M1, M2, M3)
- `ClipSync-1.0.0.dmg` - For Intel Macs
- `ClipSync-1.0.0-arm64-mac.zip` - ARM64 ZIP alternative
- `ClipSync-1.0.0-mac.zip` - Intel ZIP alternative

## âœ… Test Results

I've successfully tested the build process:

- âœ… Build completes without errors
- âœ… Both ARM64 and Intel DMG files are created
- âœ… Files are properly signed (with your existing certificate)
- âœ… File sizes are reasonable (~110-116MB)

## ðŸ”§ Available Commands

```bash
# Build specific architectures
npm run dist:mac:x64        # Intel DMG only
npm run dist:mac:arm64      # ARM64 DMG only
npm run dist:mac:universal  # Universal DMG (both architectures)

# Build all platforms
npm run dist:win            # Windows
npm run dist:linux          # Linux

# Release (with publishing)
npm run release:mac         # Publish macOS builds
npm run release             # Publish all platforms
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. **Test the builds** on different Mac architectures
2. **Set up code signing** (if you want to distribute outside GitHub)
3. **Create your first release** using one of the methods above
4. **Update README.md** with download links once released

## ðŸ“ž Need Help?

- Check `docs/RELEASE.md` for detailed instructions
- Review GitHub Actions logs if automated builds fail
- Test locally first with `./scripts/build-release.sh`

Your ClipSync project is now ready for professional releases! ðŸŽ‰
